// 6502 Instruction Set: Warm-up Exercises
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 The following exercises are designed to introduce you to the most common 6502 instructions
 that we’ll use in the beginning of our course.
 I am aware that these exercises will sound a bit pointless, and it might seem like we are simply
 moving values around the machine. But don’t worry; very soon we’ll put all these instructions
 together and create something more meaningful, like asking the PPU to paint pixels on the
 screen or keeping the score of a player or the number of enemies in our game.
 For now, all I want is for you to get familiarized with the basic instructions of the 6502 CPU.
 These exercises will cover things like different addressing modes, loading values into registers,
 storing values in memory, checking processor flags, and creating loops.
 Don’t forget that you must always include the iNES header in all exercises if you want to run and
 debug them with an emulator. You must also always add the three vectors for NMI, Reset, and
 IRQ handlers at the end of the PRG-ROM at address $FFFA.
