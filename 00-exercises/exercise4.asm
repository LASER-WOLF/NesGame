; Exercise 4
; This exercise is about adding and subtracting values. Adding and subtracting are math
; operations that are done by the processor ALU (arithmetic-logic-unit). Since the ALU
; can only manipulate values from the (A)ccumulator, all these additions and subtractions
; must be performed with the values in the A register.

    SBC #10        ; Subtract the decimal value 10 from the accumulator
