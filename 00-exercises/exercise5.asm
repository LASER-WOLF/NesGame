; Exercise 5
; The ADC and SBC instructions can also be used with different addressing modes. The
; above exercise used ADC with immediate mode (adding a literal value directly into the
; accumulator), but we can also ask ADC to add a value from a (zero page) memory
; position into the accumulator.
