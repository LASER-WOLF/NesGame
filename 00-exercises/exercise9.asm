; Exercise 9
; Your goal in this exercise is to create a simple loop that goes from 1 to 10. If possible, try
; using the CMP instruction. This instruction that can be used to compare the value of
; the accumulator with a certain literal number. Once the comparison is done, the
; processor flags will be set (zero if the compared values are equal, non-zero if different).
